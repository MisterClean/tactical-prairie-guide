3. **Plant:** For seeds, sprinkle them over the loosened soil. For seedlings, dig a small hole, place the seedling inside, and then cover the roots with soil. 

4. **Water:** Lightly water the area with your water bottle. 💧

5. **Move to the Next Spot:** Once you've planted and watered, move on to the next location and repeat the process.
